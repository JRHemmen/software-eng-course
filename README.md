## Expanded Sections on Programming Paradigms

### Functional Programming

#### **Session 2A: Introduction to Functional Programming**

- **Definition and Core Concepts**: Explaining functional programming as a paradigm centered around functions and immutability.
- **Immutability**: Emphasizing data that does not change once created.
- **First-Class and Higher-Order Functions**: Discussing functions that can be treated as variables and functions that take or return other functions.
- **Pure Functions**: Introducing functions that have no side effects and always produce the same output for the same input.
- **Data In, Data Out**: Highlighting the principle of functions taking data in and sending data out, without side effects.

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

#### **Session 2B: Understanding Object-Oriented Programming**

- **Introduction to OOP**: Explaining OOP as a paradigm based on objects that contain data and methods.
- **Classes and Instances**: Differentiating between classes (blueprints) and instances (objects created from blueprints).
- **Attributes and Methods**: Discussing how objects have attributes (data) and methods (functions) that operate on the data.
- **Encapsulation**: Introducing the concept of hiding internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through an object's methods.
- **Inheritance and Polymorphism**: Explaining how classes can inherit from other classes and how objects can be treated as instances of their parent class.

### Terminology Differences Across Languages

#### **Session 2C: Understanding Language-Specific Terminology**

- **PowerShell Custom Objects**: Explaining how PowerShell uses custom objects for data storage and manipulation, similar to classes but typically used in a more dynamic and flexible way.
- **Go Structs**: Discussing structs in Go as a way to group related data together, similar to classes but without directly supporting inheritance.
- **Python Dictionaries and Classes**: Comparing Python's flexible dictionaries for storing key-value pairs and classes for more structured object-oriented programming.
- **JavaScript Objects and Prototypes**: Explaining how JavaScript uses objects as flexible containers for data and functions, and how prototypes are used for inheritance.
- **C# Classes and Structs**: Discussing the difference between classes (reference types) and structs (value types) in C# and when to use each.

### Practical Examples and Exercises

- Provide hands-on examples and exercises for each programming paradigm and language feature discussed, using interactive tools like Jupyter notebooks for immediate feedback and experimentation.
